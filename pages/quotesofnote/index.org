  Neither can his mind be thought to be in tune,
   whose words do jarre;
  nor his reason in frame,
   whose sentence is preposterous;
  nor his elocution clear and perfect,
   whose utterance breaks itself into fragments and uncertainties.

 Whoring is to provide pleasure to another without any principle by
 which to understand whether or not pleasure and goodness are the same,

 The whole business is a comforting display of the benefits we reap from the
 First Amendment, by whose power fools are so easily led into foregoing the
 protection offered them by the Fifth.

 Where there is an inward commitment to the worth of knowledge and
 reason -- not only because they are useful, but because they are good --
 the authority of principle is enough to ensure both the interest and
 the good workmanship that lead to clarity and precision, and even to
 grace, in statement.

 Experience by itself can teach only knacks, which may indeed save a
 fool, but will hardly make him wise, or even a teacher.  It is
 thoughtful, orderly discourse about experience that leads to understanding.

 One cannot understand the least thing about modern civilization if

 He who would do good to another must do It in Minute Particulars. General Good

 We have left undone those things which we ought to have done, and we have done

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Computer languages provide the possibility of an exact and precisely limited
 correspondence not only between what is said and what is meant, but also
 between what is meant and what is so in the strictly defined system about
 which, and only about which, statements can be made.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 But this we know: that Socrates held it an act of unreason and aggression to
 manage any human resources but his own, and that to treat a person as an object
 to be used or as an agent to be turned was not the act of a reasonable man, but
 a form of impiety, the injury of a soul.

 As bad actors cannot sing alone, but only in a large company, so some men
 cannot walk alone. Man, if you are worth anything, you must walk alone, and
 talk to yourself, and not hide in the chorus. Learn to beat mockery, look about
 you, examine yourself, that you may get to know who you are.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Literacy is not a handy knack. It is a moral condition. The ability to read
 attentively, reflectively, and judiciously is equally the ability to be
 attentive, reflective, and judicious. For the sake of just and sane living,
 literacy is not an optional adornment. It is a necessity. It is _the_
 necessity. It is not a variety or portion of education. It is education. It is
 the whole thing, the wholesome nourishment of the mind, by which it may grow
 strong enough to be the master of the will and not its slave, the judge of
 desire and not its procurer, the censor of sentiment and not its tool, and the
 inquisitor of belief, and not its flack. It is our only path to whatever wisdom
 we can have, which is our only path to whatever goodness we can know, which is
 our only path to whatever happiness we can enjoy.

 Well, we know in part, we prophesy in part, and in part we babble, with the
 tongues neither of men nor of angels, reciting what we have often heard, as
 blind mouths speak to stopped ears, as no one speaks to no one.

 There's a bulimic's dream-feast of killer kontent on the way. [But] if it
 already makes you want to puke, get angry. Write it, code it, paint it, play it--
 rattle the cage however you can. Stay hungry. Stay free. And believe it: win,
 lose , or draw, we're here to stay. Armed only with imagination, we're going to
 rip the fucking lid off.

 Control is the enemy of imagination. The two aren't just incompatible; they are

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 So much for that. There is another good reason for this change. We are
 interested, obviously, in what we publish, but we are also interested in
 publishing itself. We hold that the freedom of the press not only belongs to
 the man who owns one, but even that that freedom belongs only to the man who
 owns one. Newspapers and magazines enjoy that freedom, of course, but only
 insofar as the law is concerned. They are, by obvious necessity, bound--- bound
 by the opinions and tastes of their readers and advertisers. And bound, too, by
 perfectly legitimate principles of impartiality and restraint. Even scurrilous
 publications are captive to that depravity to which they pander. But the
 private press, which is, we are convinced, what Jefferson had in mind, is free
 to be truly free. If it is free to be crazy and perverse, that is the price we
 must pay so that it will also be free to do what we always hope and intend to
 do, to curry no one's favor and to fear no one's disapproval, but to seek and
 speak the truth as best it can.

 The basic assumption of the ward system, whether Jefferson knew it or not, was
 that no one could be called happy without his share in public happiness, that
 no one could be called free without his experience in public freedom, and that
 no one could be called either happy or free without participating, and having a
 share, in public power.
