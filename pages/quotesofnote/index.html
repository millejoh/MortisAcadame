Where there is an inward commitment to the worth of knowledge and

grace, in statement.

But this we know: that Socrates held it an act of unreason and aggression to
manage any human resources but his own, and that to treat a person as an object
to be used or as an agent to be turned was not the act of a reasonable man, but
a form of impiety, the injury of a soul.

<p>
Literacy is not a handy knack. It is a moral condition. The ability to read
attentively, reflectively, and judiciously is equally the ability to be
attentive, reflective, and judicious. For the sake of just and sane living,
literacy is not an optional adornment. It is a necessity. It is <span class="underline">the</span>
necessity. It is not a variety or portion of education. It is education. It is
the whole thing, the wholesome nourishment of the mind, by which it may grow
strong enough to be the master of the will and not its slave, the judge of
desire and not its procurer, the censor of sentiment and not its tool, and the
inquisitor of belief, and not its flack. It is our only path to whatever wisdom
we can have, which is our only path to whatever goodness we can know, which is
our only path to whatever happiness we can enjoy.

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>
So much for that. There is another good reason for this change. We are
interested, obviously, in what we publish, but we are also interested in
publishing itself. We hold that the freedom of the press not only belongs to
the man who owns one, but even that that freedom belongs only to the man who
owns one. Newspapers and magazines enjoy that freedom, of course, but only
insofar as the law is concerned. They are, by obvious necessity, bound— bound
by the opinions and tastes of their readers and advertisers. And bound, too, by
perfectly legitimate principles of impartiality and restraint. Even scurrilous
publications are captive to that depravity to which they pander. But the
private press, which is, we are convinced, what Jefferson had in mind, is free
to be truly free. If it is free to be crazy and perverse, that is the price we
must pay so that it will also be free to do what we always hope and intend to
do, to curry no one's favor and to fear no one's disapproval, but to seek and
speak the truth as best it can.

The basic assumption of the ward system, whether Jefferson knew it or not, was
that no one could be called happy without his share in public happiness, that
no one could be called free without his experience in public freedom, and that
no one could be called either happy or free without participating, and having a
share, in public power.
