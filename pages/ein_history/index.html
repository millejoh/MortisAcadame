After the exciting announcement in February 2017 of the first <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny">JupyterCon</a>, I was
somewhat saddened to see no mention of the EIN, or the Emacs IPython Notebook,
as an available client to the Jupyter notebook server. Drama queen that I am, I
quickly wrote a note to Fernando, who patiently and kindly explained that not
many were aware that this project still existed and that perhaps an announcement
or note to the main Jupyter list might be warranted. Hence the following, brief
history. I also promise not to be a drama queen.
</p>

<p>
In 2013 I discoverd IPython, though maybe rediscovered is a better description.
My first experiences with Python were back in the late 90's when I maintained a
web site on my company's local internet using Zope. Up until then the majority
my admittedly sparse programming background had been in Common Lisp. While I
loved the idea of the notebook design of IPython, being relatively spoiled
having used development environments like Lispworks and SLIME I was not happy
with the user experience the web interface provided. I probably would not have
spent much time with IPython if it hadn't been for tkf's ein project.
</p>

<p>
Some of you may remember, from back when the Jupyter project was still known as
the <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-0.12/interactive/htmlnotebook.html">IPython notebook</a>, a talented and prolific coder of the name Takafumi
Arakaki, or tkf, who created an alternative client to the notebook server's
default web browser interface.
</p>

<p>
This client, which he called the Emacs IPython Notebook (which you can still
find his project on <a href="https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook">github</a>), or EIN, provided a complete ipython notebook
experience in the venerable Emacs editor. Not only was EIN nearly <a href="https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook/wiki/Screenshots">feature
complete</a> when compared to the browser interface it also provided some useful
features for the Python programmer, like allowing one to <a href="https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook/wiki/Screenshots#connected-buffer">connect</a> Python buffers
to a notebook and using jedi for autocompletion in the notebook buffer.
</p>

<p>
Around March/April of 2014, just as IPython was advancing towards 1.0 and making
big changes in the notebook/contents API and the kernel communication protocol,
tkf mysteriously stopped pushing commits to his github repository. 
</p>

<p>
I did not know tkf other than from a couple brief conversations. I sincerely
hope tkf's story has a happy end (he does appear to still push the occasional
<a href="https://github.com/tkf/comparatist">commit</a>); he is clearly a talented programmer and without him this impressive
piece of software would not exist.
</p>

<p>
This is the point where yours truly enters the story. I had discovered the
IPython notebook the previous year and had found it an exteremly useful for
analyzing the performance of catalytic process units in the refining industry
and working with Python in general, but being a long-time Emacs user I had
somewhat bounced of the web interface. Discovering EIN was a godsend, and it
quickly became a mainstay in my set of analytic tools.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the changes in transitioning to v1.0 of the ipython notebook broke
EIN, and with tkf apparently out of the picture there did not seem much hope in
EIN staying compatible. Considering that I am a father of two with a full-time
job that has absolutely nothing to do with programming (and yet I am a long-time
Emacs user - it's complicated, don't ask), I can only describe what happened
next as an act of complete insanity: I decided to fork tkf's code, dig in and
try to keep up with the changes in ipython.
</p>

<p>
Truthfully, no one was more surprised than I when I was actually able to keep
ein working with versions 1.0 and, soon after, 2.0 of IPython. In fact that
compatibility, in theory, is still in the code. One, again in theory, should be
able to fire up a 1.x or 2.x version of the IPython notebook and connect to it
using my fork of EIN. I say in theory, though, as I haven't touched that part of
the code in some time and it undoubtedly has suffered some bit rot in the
intervening years.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the story is less interesting. Eventually I managed to convince
github and MELPA to treat my repository as the official version of ein. There
was some short-lived talk of renaming my fork to 'zwei', but the consensus was
that things were confusing enough with the change in ownership and to keep the
name as ein.
</p>

<p>
Currently one can download ein through either <a href="http://melpa.org/#/ein">MELPA</a> or <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/el-get">el-get</a>, and someone has
even been kind enough to create a spacemacs <a href="http://spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/ipython-notebook/README.html">layer</a> with convenient VIM
keybindings for the heathens.
</p>

<p>
At the moment EIN supports the recent incarnations of Jupyter, v4.3.1, token
authentication, _xsrf cookies and all. By the time you read this I may even have
pushed some commits that allow one to start and automatically log in to a
jupyter notebook server all from Emacs without having to drop into the terminal.
</p>

<p>
In all, EIN continues to be a viable alternative to the web browser client. It
is not 100% feature complete, though, as it notably does not support widgets and
quite possibly never will.
</p>

<p>
I haven't kept close track of who is using EIN, but it has 341 stars on github
and 28,175 downloads from MELPA. I know EIN is being used in at least a couple
businesses and from what I have heard it tends to be more popular among those
with a programming background - scientists and engineers tend to prefer the web
client which is not surprising since Emacs is not so much a text editor as it is
a Way of Life.
</p>

<p>
I encourage anyone who is interested in trying out ein to install it via MELPA
or from the spacemacs ipython-notebook layer. There is <a href="http://millejoh.github.io/emacs-ipython-notebook/">documentation</a>, but it is
not perfect and I cannot guarantee it is 100% correct. Do not hesitate to open
an <a href="https://github.com/millejoh/emacs-ipython-notebook/issues">issue</a> on github if you run into troubles, this is a hobby project but I do my
best to support it.
</p>

<p>
If you have made it this far then my sincere thanks for staying patient through
my ramblings. As a parting thought I want to express my sincere thanks to
Takafumi Arakaki, wherever he may be, and to the <a href="http://jupyter.org/about.html">Jupyter</a> team for their
fantastic work in creating this amazing piece of software.
