I am happy to say that `Jonas Bernoulli's <https://github.com/tarsius>`_
`Kickstarter`_ has been succesfully funded as of a few days ago. There still a
few days left, so feel free to `contribute`_. More money is always good when it is
for a good cause.

My use case for git is honestly very simple as I do not contribute much to
projects other than ein and the development team for the same is simply me,
myself, and I. Even still, magit makes working with git easy and joyful and I am
glad this package exists. In case you are wondering, I did make a very modest
contribution to the campaign. If I had the means I would happily support more
Emacs developers, particularly the ones who have contributed work that make EIN
possible.

Jonas did something particularly interesting and courageous in an effort to
promote his kickstarter: he added a modest, easily removed blurb on the magit
status screen. It seems some took `offence`_ to the tactic. Unreasonably so, in
my opinion. It could not have been an easy decision for Jonas to take.

I think part of the problem is that we, and by we I mean U.S. citizens in
particular, have been conditioned to view the asking for help as an act
of despicable weakness- especially so when asking for money. There also seems to
be a bit of an attitude within some parts of the FOSS community that there
really are such things as free lunches. But that is a another topic worthy of 
its own dedicated post, and I don't plan to get into it here.

Also programmers can be sensitive to interruptions and distractions- I think
`Rands in Repose`_ diagnosed this particular condition succintly long ago
- and advertisement is certainly up there on the list of non-value added
distractions. In all, though, I think Jonas handled his plea for assistance
elegantly and succinctly. I did not feel at all distracted or coereced into
contributing to his campaign.

And contribute is the right word to use here, not give. Magit has helped me to
be succesful in my work, so it only seemed fair to contribute back to its
well-being.

Before I take leave, I have had in the back of my mind some words I read long
ago by Phil Cubeta, he of the dungeon master to the stars. I can't find the
post, unfortunately, but it had to do with levels, or rather a hierarchy, of
giving and `charity`_. Luckily a google search quickly revealed the
aforementioned link, and the below summary.

I wonder if all who struggle with the non-trivial issue of financially
supporting elisp package maintainers (and FOSS in general) wouldn't benefit at
least some from quiet consideration of Mainmonide's levels of charity.

Mainmonide's 8 levels of `charity`_ (follow that link, it is much better than
the summary below):

 1. Investing in a poor person in a manner that they can become self-sufficient.
 2. Giving to the poor without knowledge of the recipient and without allowing
    the recipient to know your identity.
 3. Giving to the poor with knowledge of the recipient but without allowing the
    recipient to know your identity (anonymous giving).
 4. Giving to the poor without knowledge of the recipient but allowing the
    recipient to know your identity.
 5. Giving to the poor without or before being asked.
 6. Giving to the poor after being asked.
 7. Giving to the poor happily but inadequately.
 8. Giving to the poor unwillingly.
