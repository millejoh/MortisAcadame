Sometimes, when the sadness comes on me, it is all I can do not to
cry. 

The sadness, my confidant, my lover, wraps her - yes, her - black,
decaying arms around me, through me. She whispers to me, a whisper
that is louder than a roar.

She fills me, infuses every cell; she drags me deep into ground.I
would crawl and drag myself free, but she steals my strength and my
will. Reason, compassion, love - all dissapear. All she leaves behind
is a silent desperation, a quiet anxiety, a deep pessimism, a sure
knowledge that things will *not* be okay. There isn't enough
money. There isn't enough time. You will never be the person you
wanted to be, much less what she wants you to be. The children are
growing up too fast; they aren't going to be ready for what
comes. Your best days are behind you, but there is still so much to be
done. You are at your weakest and everyone is depending on you to save
them.

She holds me down while the harpies pull, rend and feast on my flesh.
